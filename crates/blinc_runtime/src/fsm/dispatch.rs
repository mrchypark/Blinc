//! Backend-agnostic guard dispatch.
//!
//! Event-driven transitions resolve in pure Rust by reading the
//! [`super::registry::FsmRegistry`]. Tick-driven transitions can't
//! — they call user-authored guard expressions (lifted to
//! stand-alone functions by the DSL post-parse pass) that need
//! whichever compile backend produced them.
//!
//! This module is the boundary. A backend implements
//! [`GuardDispatcher::call_guard`] and registers an instance via
//! [`set_guard_dispatcher`]; the [`super::instance::FsmStateId`]
//! widget shim calls into the trait object without knowing
//! whether the actual call goes through Cranelift's JIT
//! (`runtime.call_function`) or a direct extern-C function
//! pointer (AOT-linked binary).
//!
//! The trait is intentionally small: each guard is a zero-arg
//! function returning `i32` (1 = fire, 0 = don't). This matches
//! how `blinc_dsl_core::populate_fsm_registry_pass` lifts
//! guard expressions today, and is trivially representable in
//! the AOT path's static symbol table.

///   in-process.
/// - `AotGuardDispatcher` (future, in a per-app generated crate
///   or in `blinc_runtime::aot`) — wraps a static table of
