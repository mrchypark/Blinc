//! Runtime-agnostic FSM registry: pure data + process-wide

//!
//! No Zyntax types here — the registry holds plain `Arc<str>`
//! names and `u32` codes so that both the JIT path
//! (`blinc_dsl_core`, which intern-resolves to `Arc<str>` at
//! registration) and the AOT path (a future codegen that writes
//! the same `Arc<str>` literals into a generated registration
//! function) share one identical shape.
//!
//! Each FSM is registered as a [`FsmDefinition`] keyed by an
//! [`FsmId`]. State variants and event codes are pre-assigned
//! `u32` values at registration time so the per-instance
//! [`super::instance::FsmStateId`] (which must be `Copy`) can
//! identify a state with just two integers.
