# Changelog

All notable changes to `blinc_app` will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### 3D SDF & Styling Demo

- Expanded `styling_demo` example with 3D shape showcases (box, sphere, cylinder, torus, capsule)
- 3D boolean operations demo (union, subtract, intersect, smooth variants)
- 3D group composition examples with compound shapes
- UV-mapped gradient backgrounds on 3D surfaces
- `translate-z` depth positioning examples
- Blinn-Phong lighting configuration examples

#### Stylesheet Runtime Integration

- CSS animation support wired through the app runtime
- `backdrop-filter` property support in windowed runner
- Stylesheet base styles applied after tree construction
- CSS transition ticking and application in frame loop
- Animated layout property support with per-frame `compute_layout()` recomputation

#### Styling Demo Enhancements

- CSS filter hover demo (`.filter-card:hover` with brightness, saturate, contrast)

### Fixed

- CSS animation ticking moved to synchronous main-thread execution to eliminate phase jitter caused by background-thread timing misalignment
- Mid-frame transition redraw: transitions created during `apply_complex_selector_styles` now properly trigger frame requests (prevents stalled hover-leave animations)
- iOS runner cleanup for platform trait consistency
- Clippy warnings in windowed.rs and ios.rs

## [0.1.12] - 2025-01-19

### Added
- Momentum scrolling for touch devices with velocity tracking
- `dispatch_scroll_chain_with_time()` method for mobile scroll dispatch with time-based velocity
- Single-threaded animation scheduler for mobile efficiency

### Changed
- Android render loop now uses vsync for frame pacing instead of manual timing
- Non-blocking poll when animating, 100ms idle timeout for power saving
- Re-enabled scroll physics for bounce animations on Android

### Fixed
- Animation smoothness on Android by removing mutex contention between threads
- Double-waiting issue that was cutting frame rate in half
- Added expected cfg values for fuchsia and ohos targets to fix CI warnings

## [0.1.1] - Initial Release

- Initial public release with desktop, Android, and iOS support
