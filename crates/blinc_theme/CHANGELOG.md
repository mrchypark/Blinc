# Changelog

All notable changes to `blinc_theme` will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Universal HID variants — `RestrainedTheme`, `HybridTheme`, `ExpressiveTheme`** plus `DefaultTheme` alias (= `HybridTheme`). Three considered cross-platform synthesis variants with per-variant `RadiusTokens` ladders, `ShapeTokens` (superellipse smoothing), and semantic-easing assignments. `cn_bundle()` defaults to `HybridTheme` when the platform doesn't match a built-in.
- **`ShapeTokens`** (`corner_smoothing`, `corner_exponent`, `smoothing_threshold`). Theme-driven squircle smoothing applied per-corner at paint time via a new `resolve_corner_shape` helper. Defaults to `is_off()` so existing themes (BlincTheme, platform themes) keep circular corners unchanged.
- **`--focus-ring`, `--focus-ring-error`, `--focus-ring-success` CSS variables** — alpha-tinted (35 %) variants of `BorderFocus` / `BorderError` / `Success`, derived at frame time so user-written CSS can reference the same soft halo colour the focus ring uses.
- **Semantic easing CSS variables** — `--ease-default`, `--ease-in`, `--ease-out`, `--ease-in-out`, `--ease-emphasized`, `--ease-decelerated`, `--ease-accelerated` derived from the active variant's `AnimationTokens`. Lets framework-level CSS rules (in `cn`) and user stylesheets resolve to the same easings the Rust API uses.
- **`cubic-bezier()` parsing** in the CSS animation-timing path, so `transition: opacity 200ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0)` resolves correctly against the variant tokens.

### Changed
- `radius_default` bumped per variant so it lands at or above each variant's `smoothing_threshold`. Pre-fix, components consuming `--radius-default` (cn::button / cn::input / cn::card) all fell back to a true circle and never picked up the variant squircle.
- `HybridTheme` swapped in as the no-match fallback (was `BlincTheme`). `BlincTheme` is still available as a named opt-in theme.
